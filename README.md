# Resident Evil Outbreak File #2 Decompilation Project

## Project Description
This project is dedicated to the decompilation of the PlayStation 2 game "Resident Evil Outbreak File #2". Currently, the project involves organizing the raw assembly code extracted from the game and recompiling it back into readable and structured C code. This effort aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the game's architecture and coding practices, and eventually contribute to the preservation and study of video game software.

## Current Status
As of now, the project is in the early stages, focusing on:
- Mapping out and documenting the assembly code structure.
- Establishing methodologies for translating the assembly code to C.

## Objectives
- **Documentation**: Thoroughly document the assembly code and its functionalities.
- **Recompilation**: Develop tools and techniques to reliably translate the assembly code back into C.

## Getting Involved
This project is open-source, and welcome contributions from anyone interested in video games, reverse engineering, or software preservation. If you'd like to contribute or have suggestions, please reach out via our project repository.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and preservation purposes only. It does not endorse piracy, and participants are advised to ensure they own legal copies of the game and comply with all relevant copyright laws.
